A React app using the Clarifai API for face recognition. Through this project, I gained knowledge on integrating apps with APIs, using state for routing, validating user input, and securely hashing and storing user data in a database. Additionally, I created a server using Express.js and set up a PostgreSQL database. At that stage of my learning, I had only learned how to create object-based React apps.
