A React app using the Clarifai API for face recognition. Through this project, I gained knowledge on integrating apps with APIs, using state for routing, validating user input, and securely hashing and storing user data in a database. Additionally, I created a server using Express.js and set up a PostgreSQL database. At that stage of my learning, I had only learned how to create object-based React apps.

If you are not able to register you can always use "test" for login and password.

Project created during my "The Complete Web Developer" course created by Andrei Neagoie on udemy platform where I learned basics of how the internet works, React, rest API, Express and PosgreSQL. https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/
