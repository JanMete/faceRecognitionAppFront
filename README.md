A React app using the Clarifai API for face recognition. Through this project, I gained knowledge on integrating apps with APIs, using state for routing, validating user input, and securely hashing and storing user data in a database. Additionally, I created a server using Express.js and set up a PostgreSQL database. At that stage of my learning, I had only learned how to create object-based React apps.

Project created during my "The Complete Web Developer" course created by Andrei Neagoie on udemy platform where I learned basics of how the internet works, React, rest API, Express and PosgreSQL. https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/
